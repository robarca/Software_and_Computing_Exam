# Weighting Functions and Transmittances 

This is a simple model to compute the weighting functions and transmittances in clear air and in presence of a cloud layer. 

Here, it is assumed that:
- Clouds only absorb and emit (i.e there is no scattering);
- The system is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so that Kirchhoff's law is still valid, and the base the atmosphere is at 0 km and the top at 50 km;
- It's considered a plane-parallel atmosphere using height (_z_) as vertical coordinate .

Considering the optical depth, defined as :

![optical_depth](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctau%20%3D%20%5Cint_%7Bz%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7D%20k_%7B%5Cnu%7D%28z%5E%7B%27%7D%29%5Crho_%7Ba%7D%28z%5E%7B%27%7D%29dz%27)

the monochromatic **transmittance** is defined as a function of the optical depth and the zenith angle:

![transmittance](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T_%7B%5Cnu%7D%5Cleft%20%28%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctau%20%7D%7B%5Cmu%20%7D%20%5Cright%20%29%3De%5E%7B-%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctau%20%7D%7B%5Cmu%20%7D%7D)

In Atmospheric Physics, when only absorption and emission processes are relevant for our problem, it's possible to write the Schwarzschildâ€™s equation solution to compute upwelling and downwelling radiance at any height and in any direction. In particular the upwelling monochromatic radiance at the top of the atmosphere (_zT_) is: 

![f1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L%28z_T%2C%5Cmu%29%3DL%28z_0%2C%5Cmu%29e%5E%7B-%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7Dk%5Crho%20_%7Ba%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D%7D&plus;%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7D%20kBe%5E%7B-%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7Dk%5Crho%20_%7Ba%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%27%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D%7D%5Crho%20_%7Ba%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D)

It is quite evident that radiance reaching any level in the atmosphere in any direction depends strongly on the absorption cross section, _k_.

A second form of the solution can be written using the concept of **Weighting Function** (_W_):

![f2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?W%28z%2Cz_T%29%5Cequiv%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Ctau%28z%2Cz_T%29%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20z%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%5Crho_%7Ba%7D%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D%5Ctau%28z%2Cz_T%29)

so we have: 

![wavefunc](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L%28z_T%2C%5Cmu%29%3DL%28z_0%2C%5Cmu%29e%5E%7B-%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7Dk%5Crho%20_%7Ba%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%27%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D%7D&plus;%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7D%20B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Ctau%28z%2Cz_T%29%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20z%7Ddz)

The role of the weighting function can be understood thanks to next example graphs:

![Transvs](https://player.slideplayer.com/16/5022384/data/images/img21.jpg) ![weightvs](https://player.slideplayer.com/16/5022384/data/images/img22.jpg)

The left panel displays the vertical profile of transmissivity and the right panel displays the weighting functions, computed as showen above. The various colors denote 4 different absorption cross sections _k_ while the temperature and concentration profiles are the same.
The blu line is showing a situation that could arise if it's considered an atmospheric window: transmissivity doesn't change a lot, at the surface it is 0.9, which implies that 90% of the energy from the surface is reaching the top of the atmosphere. Watching at the corrispective weighting function profile, it's possible to see that most energy comes from the surface, but also a little from the atmosphere.
Moving towards more absorbing wave numbers (green curve) the transmissivity decreases and only 25% of the energy that is going out from the surface reaches the top of the atmosphere, while the weighting function shows that most of the energy comes from the layers close to the surface, but it also arrives in minor part from layers close to 20 km. For the red and blue curves the surface transmissivity is zero and the associated weighting functions have a maximum in correspondence the inflection of the transmissivity curve, which indicates where the signal mainly comes from.

## General Variables

To run the model it's very importanto to understand what the variables in the _Configuration.ini_ file rapresent:

**Bottom_cloud** rapresents the quote [km] of the cloud's base. It must be a value between the top and the bottom of the atmosphere (defined later);

**Top_cloud** rapresents the quote [km] of the cloud's base. As above, it must be a value between the top and the bottom of the atmosphere (defined later);

**Cross_section_abs_gas** defines the capacity of the atmosphere to absorb the incoming radiation. It's used to compute the optical depth;

**Abs_coeff_cloud** defines the capacity of the cloud to absorb the radiation;

**Top_level** is the maximum height that is rapresented on the final plots;

**vertical_height_scale** is the scale parameter for the exponential density profile;

## How to run the model

If an user wants to run the model, there are same simple steps to follow:

- It's suggested to check beforehand that the parameters are correct for the type of analysis to be carried out (so in this case the first file to edit and then run is the [Make_Configuration.py](https://github.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/blob/master/Make_Configuration.py))

i.e for Linux users:

        python3 Make_Configuration.py
        
- Finally, it's possible to run the model with the file [WFT_Profile.py](https://github.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/blob/master/WFT_Profile.py)

i.e for Linux users:

        python3 WFT_Profile.py

## Output's storage

Once the model has worked correctly, the final plots are saved in the [OUTPUT](https://github.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/tree/master/OUTPUT) folder.

Here it's possible to find three figures:

- [Transmittances in clear and cloud sky.png](https://github.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/blob/master/OUTPUT/Transmittances%20in%20clear%20and%20cloud%20sky.png) which is a plot showing the tranmittance profiles for clear and cloudy sky;
- [Weighting functions for clear and cloudy sky.png](https://github.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/blob/master/OUTPUT/Weighting%20functions%20for%20clear%20and%20cloudy%20sky.png) shows the weighting function profiles for clear and cloudy sky;
- [Log weighting functions for clear and cloudy sky.png](https://github.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/blob/master/OUTPUT/Log%20weighting%20functions%20for%20clear%20and%20cloudy%20sky.png) which rapresents the weighting functions for clear and cloudy sky in semi-logarithmic scale.

## Example 1: Low Level Clouds 

In the next two plots are shown the transmittance profile (top chart) and the weighting function profile (below chart) for a low stratus cloud, with base at 1 km (i.e. _bottom_cloud_=1) and top at 2 km (i.e. _top_cloud_=2) . 

_Cross_section_abs_gas_ = 0.003
_Abs_coeff_cloud_ = 5

![fig1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/master/OUTPUT/Transmittances%20in%20clear%20and%20cloud%20sky.png)

![fig2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/master/OUTPUT/Weighting%20functions%20for%20clear%20and%20cloudy%20sky.png)

Here it's possible to see that the code shows the role of the cloud between 1 and 2 km. As it's shown in transimattance's profile, considering cloudy sky (red line), there is a strong reduction in concomitance of the cloud, due to the absorption by the same of part of the incoming radiation. On the other hand, whatching the waighting function profile for cloudy sky (yellow line) it's confirmed that most of the energy is released exactly from the height where the cloud is.

## Example 2: Low vs High-Level Clouds Transmittances

In this example a further interesting use of the model is shown: the comparison between the transmittance profiles considering clouds at different altitudes. The  values of _Cross_section_abs_gas_ and _Abs_coeff_cloud_ are the same.

- In the first plot is shown an atmosphere having a cloud between 1 and 2 km:

![fig3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/master/fig_example/low_transmittance.png)

- In the second one there's a cloud between 12 and 15 km:

![fig4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robarca/Software_and_Computing_Exam/master/fig_example/Transmittances%20in%20clear%20and%20cloud%20sky.png)

As it is possible to understand from the two plots, the transmittance profiles for clear sky (blu lines) don't change; while you can see a big difference in the cloudy sky profiles (red lines) due to the fact that if the cloud is higher there's a strong reduction of the radiance at that quote which means that the underlying layers won't recieve the same incoming energy as the low level cloud case.
