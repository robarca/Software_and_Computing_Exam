# Weighting Functions and Transmittances 

This is a simple model to compute the weighting functions and transmittances in clear air and in presence of a cloud layer. 

Here, it is assumed that clouds only absorb and emit (i.e there is no scattering), that the system is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so that Kirchhoff's law is still valid, and that it's considered a plane-parallel atmosphere using height (_z_) as vertical coordinate .

Considering the optical depth, defined as :

![optical_depth](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctau%20%3D%20%5Cint_%7Bz%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7D%20k_%7B%5Cnu%7D%28z%5E%7B%27%7D%29%5Crho_%7Ba%7D%28z%5E%7B%27%7D%29dz%27)

the monochromatic **transmittance** is defined as a function of the optical depth and the zenith angle:

In Atmospheric Physics, when only absorption and emission processes are relevant for our problem, it's possible to write the Schwarzschildâ€™s equation solution to compute upwelling and downwelling radiance at any height and in any direction. In particular the upwelling monochromatic radiance at the top of the atmosphere (_zT_) is: 

![f1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L%28z_T%2C%5Cmu%29%3DL%28z_0%2C%5Cmu%29e%5E%7B-%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7Dk%5Crho%20_%7Ba%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D%7D&plus;%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7D%20kBe%5E%7B-%5Cint_%7Bz_0%7D%5E%7Bz_T%7Dk%5Crho%20_%7Ba%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%27%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D%7D%5Crho%20_%7Ba%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D)

It is quite evident that radiance reaching any level in the atmosphere in any direction depends strongly on the absorption cross section, _k_.

A second form of the solution can be written using the concept of **Weighting Function** (_W_):

![f2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?W%28z%2Cz_T%29%5Cequiv%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Ctau%28z%2Cz_T%29%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20z%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7Bk%5Crho_%7Ba%7D%7D%7B%5Cmu%7D%5Ctau%28z%2Cz_T%29)

so we have:

The role of the weighting function can be understood thanks to next example graphs:

The left panel displays the vertical profile of transmissivity and the right panel displays the weighting functions, computed as showen above. The various colors denote 4 different absorption cross sections _k_ while the temperature and concentration profiles are the same.
The blu line is showing a situation that could arise if it's considered an atmospheric window: transmissivity doesn't change a lot, at the surface it is 0.9, which implies that 90% of the energy from the surface is reaching the top of the atmosphere. Watching at the corrispective weighting function profile, it's possible to see that most energy comes from the surface, but also a little from the atmosphere.
Moving towards more absorbing wave numbers (green curve) the transmissivity decreases and only 35% of the energy that is going out from the surface reaches the top of the atmosphere, while the weighting function shows that most of the energy comes from the layers close to the surface, but it also arrives in minor part from layers close to 20 km. For the red and blue curves the surface transmissivity is zero and the associated weighting functions have a maximum in correspondence the inflection of the transmissivity curve, which indicates where the signal mainly comes from.
